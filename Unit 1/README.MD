:warning:  _NOTE: Having made the program and tried several ways, I could not use the Numpy library. For some time I have had problems with my operating system (ubuntu) so it may be related to this and not being able to install the necessary packaging to use it. I have tried to use another programming environment to see better results, but I am still learning how to use it, the one I am using is Jupyter._
